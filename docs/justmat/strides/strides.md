strides is a 4 track finger drum pattern recorder for norns.

## norns

- key1 = hold to access secondary encoder functions
	* enc1 = main volume / distortion amount
	* enc2 = delay time / delay level
	* enc3 = delay feedback / delay send
- key2 = half time
- key3 = double time

nb: delay send works on all samples and tracks. if you wish to send individual samples to delay, you can do so via the PARAMETERS menu.
