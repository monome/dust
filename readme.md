# dust: norns incantations

user data for the norns system

- `scripts` - scripts, subfolders by author
- `lib/sc` - engines
- `lib/lua` - lua modules

## contributions

dust was created by many people. contributions are welcome.

- collaboration is encouraged. when modifying an existing script please consider contributing to the original rather than submitting a new version with minor differences.  
- please include documentation for any scripts submitted (particularly the comment text at the top of the script).
- do not submit semi-functioning works-in-progress.
- make a concerted attempt at code legibility. (style guide forthcoming.)
- feel free to create your own subfolder in `scripts`.
- bug fixes are always appreciated!
